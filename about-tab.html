    <p>Hi! I'm Serban, a junior app developer passionate about tech, nature explorer and big fan of <abbr title="Volkswagen">Vw</abbr> campers, currently on a mission to get his family outdoors more often and more easily.</p>

    <p>I live in Bolton, England and love exploring the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>'s National Trust Heritages and National Parks together with my wife in our <abbr title="Volkswagen">Vw</abbr> T5. It's interesting to see that nowdays you get
        to use the term "glamping" instead of "camping", simply because you probably don't trust the classic tent anymore or the weather outside(expecially in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>).</p>
