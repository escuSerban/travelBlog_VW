# Personal Blog Project

This was my first project during the Front End Web Developer Nanogeree program at Udacity.
It required to utilize my HTML and CSS skills to build out a responsive personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, I had to appropriately structure my files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.
